The first data set we are going to analyse is gotten from students in Poland,it contains
33 variables and 649 observations in which there are 17 categorical variables(factor variables) and 16 quantitative variables which are all related to the student's social-life and
how their social life affect their final grades.
```{r echo=TRUE,results='hide',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
student_por <- read_csv("C:/Users/soar/Desktop/student-por.csv")
glimpse(student_por)
M<-cor(student_por[c(3,7,8,13,14,24:33)])
corrplot(M,method="number")#Checking the correlation of each variable we observed the highest
#correlation between studytime,mothers education with that of Grade 1,Grade2,Grade 3
# Scatterplot
```
Checking the correlation of each variable we observed the highest
correlation between studytime,mothers education and fathers education with that of Grade 1,Grade2,Grade 3
Lets visualise using a Scatterplot
```{r include=TRUE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,ECHO=FALSE}
theme_set(theme_bw())  # pre-set the between theme.
g <- ggplot(student_por, aes(studytime, G1))

       y="Grade One", 
       x="Study Time", 
       title="Correlation of Study Time Vs Grade")#We can notice a weak positive correlation

```

#Now lets explore how daily alcohol consumption,Fathers education could affect all the student grades
student_por$Dalc <- as.factor(student_por$Dalc)      
student_por$Dalc <- mapvalues(student_por$Dalc, 
                              from = 1:5, 
                              to = c("Very Low", "Low", "Medium", "High", "Extreme"))

student_por$Walc <- as.factor(student_por$Walc)      
student_por$Walc <- mapvalues(student_por$Walc, 
                              from = 1:5, 
                              to = c("Very Low", "Low", "Medium", "High", "Extreme"))

student_por$Medu <- as.factor(student_por$Medu)      
student_por$Medu <- mapvalues(student_por$Medu, 
                              from = 0:4, 
                              to = c("No education", "level one", "level two", "level three", "level four"))

student_por$Fedu <- as.factor(student_por$Fedu)      
student_por$Fedu <- mapvalues(student_por$Fedu, 
                              from = 0:4, 
                              to = c("No education", "level one", "level two", "level three", "level four"))

```

Now lets explore how daily alcohol consumption,Fathers education could affect all the student grades
```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
 x1 <-  ggplot(student_por, aes(x=Dalc, y=G1, fill=Dalc))+geom_violin(fill="blue")+
  geom_boxplot(width = .2, 
               fill = "orange",
               outlier.color = "orange",
               outlier.size = 2)+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  xlab("Alcohol consumption")+
  ylab("Grade")+
  ggtitle("First Grade")
 

x2 <- ggplot(student_por, aes(x=Dalc, y=G2, fill=Dalc))+geom_violin(fill = "blue")+
  geom_boxplot(width = .2, 
               fill = "orange",
               outlier.color = "orange",
               outlier.size = 2)+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  xlab("Alcohol consumption")+
  ylab("Grade")+
  ggtitle("Second Grade")

x3 <- ggplot(student_por, aes(x=Dalc, y=G3, fill=Dalc))+geom_violin(fill="blue")+
  geom_boxplot(width = .2, 
               fill = "orange",
               outlier.color = "orange",
               outlier.size = 2)+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  xlab("Alcohol consumption")+
  ylab("Grade")+
  ggtitle("Third Grade")

grid.arrange(x1,x2,x3,ncol=3)
```
From the plot we can notice that those that consume very low alcohol daily get the highest grade
but the grade distribution becomes consistent as one consumes more alcohol on daily basis
though there are few outliers to consider.
let us visualise if Mothers education has an effect on students grade
```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(student_por, aes(x = G1)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "forestgreen",
                 color = "white") +
  facet_wrap(~Medu, ncol = 1) +
  labs(title = "Grade histograms by Mothers Education level")+
  xlab("Grade score")
```
From the graph we can see that children with uneducated mothers perform badly
We can conclude that Mothers Education,Students study time and student alcohol intake has a 
minimal role to play in influencing students Grade.

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
#lets compare how fathers education affect students grade using a density ridge plot
ggplot(student_por, aes(x=G3, y=Fedu, fill=Fedu))+
  geom_density_ridges()+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  ggtitle("Fathers Education Vs Student Grade")+
  ylab("Fathers Education")+
  xlab("Students Grade")
```
Fathers education slightly affects the student performance in school.The children of Fathers with level three and four education,have a higher ridge(ridge peakness is higher) at marks between 15 to 20 unlike that of children with uneducated fathers when we are not considering the oulier in this for the later.

The second data set we are going to work with talks about African Crises focusing on financial
instability of 13 different African countries from 1860 to 2014,made up of 14 columns and 1,059 observations which include 3categorical variable and 11 quantitative variables.

```{r message=FALSE,results="hide"}
Afrik <- read_csv("C:/Users/soar/Desktop/african_crises.csv")
glimpse(Afrik)
```

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
Afrik_Ind <- Afrik %>% 
select(country, year, independence) %>% 
filter(independence == 1) %>% 
group_by(country) %>% 
slice(1) %>% 
select(-independence) %>% 
arrange(desc(year))
Afrik_Ind
ggplot(Afrik,aes(x = country, y= year,fill = country)) + 
geom_boxplot()+coord_flip()

```
Egypt was the first and Angola was the last to gain their Independence
Next we visualize each country's cases and their crises
```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
Afrik %>% 
  mutate(systemic_crisis = ifelse(systemic_crisis == 1, 'yes', 'no')) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  count(systemic_crisis) %>% 
  spread(systemic_crisis, n) %>% 
  mutate(yes = ifelse(is.na(yes), 0, yes)) %>% 
  gather('no', 'yes', key = 'systemic_crisis', value = "cases") %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(country, +cases), y = cases, fill = systemic_crisis)) + geom_col(position = 'dodge') +
  
  labs(x = 'Country', y = 'Count by cases',
       title = 'Numbers of systemic crisis by each country from (1860-2014)')+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, vjust=0.6)) + 
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Systemic Crisis", labels = c('No', 'Yes')) 
  
```
The graph shows each  cases count and whether it led to a systematic crises or not
From the graph,Egypt has the highest financial cases  but Central African Republic and Zimbabwe 
has the highest systematic crises.The graph shows how each country manages their cases.
 
```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
Afrik %>% 
    mutate(inflation_crises = ifelse(inflation_crises == 1, 'yes', 'no')) %>% 
    group_by(country) %>% 
    count(inflation_crises) %>% 
    spread(inflation_crises, n)  %>% 
    mutate(percentyesinf_crises = (yes/(yes+no)))%>%
    ggplot(aes(x = reorder(country, +percentyesinf_crises), y = percentyesinf_crises)) + 
    geom_point(stat = "identity", size = 4, pch = 21, fill = "blue")+
      geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.075)+ 
    scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position="none") +
    labs(x = 'Country', y = '', title = 'Inflation rate percent for each country',
         subtitle = 'Period analysed (1860-2014)') +
    coord_flip()
    
```
I took the count of yes and no inflation crises for each country,then calculated the 
fraction of yes for each country trying to find out country with highest  inflation crises
then converted to percentage,from the plot,Angola has the highest inflation rate and
South Africa has the lowest

Lets analyze how this affected their exchange rate in dollars

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
Afrik %>% 
select(country,exch_usd)%>%
group_by(country) %>% 
summarise(min_exch_usd = min(exch_usd),
          max_exch_usd = max(exch_usd))%>% 
arrange(desc(max_exch_usd)) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = reorder(country, + max_exch_usd), y = max_exch_usd, fill = country)) + geom_col() +
theme_bw() + theme(legend.position="none") +
labs(x = 'Country', y = '', 
       title = 'Maximum exchange rate(in usd) of each country',
       subtitle = 'Period analysed (1860-2014)') + coord_flip()
```
From the graph it can be seen that Central African Republic has the maximum exchange rate 
Zambia has the minimum exchange rate
In carrying out Exploratory data analysis on African banking crises and visualizing the graph   
We can conclude that countries with highest systematic crises have the highest exchange rate
We can say that systematic crises have a role to play in exchange rate.

The final data set we will visualise is talking about the world and its ecosystem,how different
countries interact with thier ecosystem and how their activities plays a role in affecting
the ecosystem.
Data set consist of 21 variables with 188 observations.We have 4 categorical variables and
17 quantitative variables
First we define some terms or variables used

Ecological footprint: simply put this measures how fast we consume resources and generate waste
compared to how fast nature can absorb our waste and generate new resources.
This ecological footprint is composed of six components
Built up land,Fishing ground,Forest,Grazing land,Crop land and carbon footprint.
As we dive deep into visualization we can define new terms.
```{r message=FALSE,results="hide",warning=FALSE}
ecology <- read_csv("C:/Users/soar/Desktop/countries.csv")
glimpse(ecology)
```

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
ecology %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  summarise(EcoFootprintMedian = median(`Total Ecological Footprint`, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(Country = reorder(Country,EcoFootprintMedian)) %>%
  arrange(desc(EcoFootprintMedian)) %>%
  head(10)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Country,y = EcoFootprintMedian)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity', fill = "red") +
    geom_text(aes(x = Country, y = 1, label = paste0("(",EcoFootprintMedian,")",sep="")),
              hjust=0, vjust=.5, size = 4, colour = "black",
              fontface = 'italic') +
    labs(x = 'Countries', 
         y = 'Ecological Footprint', 
         title = 'Countries With Highest EcoFootprint(gha)') +
    coord_flip() +  theme(legend.position = "") 
```
wE can view the first 10 countries with the highest footprint this means the consume much more natural resources than they produce and much energy than they absorb.
Reordering the countries by region
```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
ecology %>% group_by(Region) %>% tally() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Region, n), n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
  theme() +
  ggtitle("Number of countries by regions") +
  geom_text(aes(x = Region, y = 1, label = paste0(n)),
            hjust=0.15, vjust=.5, size = 4, colour = 'black',
            fontface = 'bold') +
  coord_flip() 
```
Africa has the highest number of countries in its region
```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
ecology %>% group_by(Region) %>% summarise(Total = sum(`Population (millions)`)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Region, Total, fill = Region)) + geom_histogram(stat = "identity") +
  theme() +
  ggtitle("Total population per Region") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 20, vjust = 0.65))
```
From the plot Asia-pacific region has the highest population
Does their population affect their ecological footprint?Lets find out with further visuals
 

Comparing biocapacities across Regions
Bio-capacity represents the productivity of its ecological 
assets (including cropland etc).
```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(ecology, aes(x = Region, y = ecology$`Total Biocapacity`, fill = Region))+
geom_boxplot()+scale_y_log10()+
ggtitle("Comparing Total Biocapacity across Regions") +
geom_jitter(alpha =0.7) + ylab("Biocapacity") + theme(legend.position = "")+
coord_flip()
```

North America has the highest Bio-capacity,followed by European union and Northern/Eastern 
Europe, Middle East and Central Asia has the lowest Biocapacity followed by Africa.
does this Bio-capacity affect their Human Development Index? Lets find out
```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
by_region <- ecology %>%
  group_by(HDI, Region) %>%
  summarize(BiocapacityMedian = median(`Total Biocapacity`),
            MedianPop = median(`Population (millions)`))
ggplot(by_region, aes(x = HDI, y = BiocapacityMedian, color = Region, size = MedianPop)) +
geom_point(alpha=0.7) + ylab("Biocapacity") + 
labs(title="Biocapacity Vs Human Development Index") +
scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "green", "red", "orange", "purple" ,"black" ,"pink")) +
xlab("Human Development") 
#Taking the median of Biocapacity inorder to consider outliers

```

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(ecology, aes(x = Region, y = ecology$HDI, fill = Region))+
  geom_boxplot()+scale_y_log10()+
  ggtitle("Comparing Human development across Regions") +
  geom_jitter(alpha =0.7) + ylab("HDI") + theme(legend.position = "")+
  coord_flip()
```
Just like we suspected North America and European union had the highest Biocapacity in our
Previous plot and the highest Human Development Index.Africa is the least considering the fact that their biocapicity is the least.


#Distribution of each Eco-Footprint variable
```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
ecologya <-ecology
ecologya <- ecologya %>% gather(Biocapacity, Land, 7:11)

ggplot(ecologya, aes(x = HDI , `Total Biocapacity`, color = Region)) +
geom_point(alpha=0.7) +
facet_wrap(~Biocapacity) + scale_y_log10() +labs(title = "Distribution of Eco-Footprint Components by Regions") +
theme(legend.position = "bottom") + 
scale_color_manual(values = c("forestgreen", "darkviolet", "gold", "blue", "brown" ,"red" ,"black"))
```
Considering each footprint,the european union has been consistent in maintaining high
Biocapacity,we can see outliers from Latin-American region
This is because two countries from that region have the highest Biocapacity among all the foot
print components,North/Eastern region takes the lead in Human Development.

The map shows regions with bio-capacity Deficit and Reserve.
Regions on Reserve : countries of South-America, countries in mid to south Africa, Oceania, North Europe
Regions on Deficit : European Union, East Europe, USA, North Africa, Middle East, Asia
Conclusion:

From the map we can see that the ratio of Deficit per Region is bigger than that of reserve a lot of improvement needs to be done.
Importance of this ecological footprint:

It helps individuals to understand their impact on the planet

It helps leaders to optimize public project.
When a region runs a biocapacity deficit. Its demand for the goods and services that land and seas can provide—fruits and vegetables, meat, fish, wood, cotton for clothing, and carbon dioxide absorption—exceeds what the region’s ecosystems can regenerate. 
If a region’s biocapacity exceeds its Ecological Footprint, it has a biocapacity reserve.

The longitude and latitude of this map was gotten from downloaded csv file in the internet for all countries longitude and latitude.I attached the file with other submitted files
